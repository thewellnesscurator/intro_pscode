ï»¿Task C: Product Package Counter


You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.




SET variable maxProducts = 100
SET variable productCount = 2


While productCount <= maxPackages:
    Increase productCount by 2 per scan 
    Print current value of productCount
    Endwhile productCount = maxProducts
