ï»¿Task B: Find the Spot


Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer. The customer can move north, south, east, or west.


Think of the warehouse in 2D grid with an x-axis and y-axis.


Define movements/directions that customer can move
    IF North:
      Move up the aisle (0 on x-axis, +1 on y-axis)
    IF South:
      Move down the aisle (0 on x-axis, -1 on y-axis)
    IF East:
      Move right to the adjacent aisle (+1 on x-axis, 0 on y-axis)
    IF West:
      Move left  to the adjacent aisle (-1 on x-axis, 0 on y-axis)


SET variable startingLocation
   Store starting coordinates as start_X, start_y 
SET variable currentLocation
   Store current coordinates as customer changes locations
SET variable targetLocation
   Store target coordinates as end_x, end_y


While desired move (x, y) != coordinates blocked by shelves, walls, or items and != coordinates outside of the warehouse and != targetLocation
   Move to the desired location/coordinates.
   EndWhile currentLocation = targetLocation
