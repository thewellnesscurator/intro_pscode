Display message: “I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Good luck trying to guess! I’ll give you 3 chances to get it right.”


SET variable playerGuess to 0 (integer) 
SET variable remainingGuesses to 3 (integer)

      Else if playerGuess < randomNumber:
         Display message: “Too low! Try again.”
         Decrease remaningGuesses by 1.
      Else if  playerGuess > randomNumber:
         Display message: “Too high! Try again.”
         Decrease remaningGuesses by 1.
      If remainingGuesses = 0 and playerGuess != randomNumber:
